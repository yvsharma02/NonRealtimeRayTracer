# NonRealtimeRayTracer
A very simple non-real time ray tracer written in C#. It's purpose was to be understand how ray tracing works, not efficiency or usability.
Please note: Due to using Windows.Graphics library, this currently only works on windows.

Examples:
(One sphere has reflection on, while one has it off (but has a texture on it))<br/>
